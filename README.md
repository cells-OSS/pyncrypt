# pyncrypt
A simple file encryption script made using Python.

This script will encrypt the files that you choose, the testing so far shows that it works with text files.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK, I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DATA LOSS, THERE IS A DECRYPTOR SCRIPT ON A DIFFERENT REPOSITORY, WHICH CAN BE FOUND HERE:

This script has been inspired by NetworkChuck: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtMMjXOlRQc

Credits to him, this script at core has the code from NetworkChuck. It's just a fun project I wanted to try, he on his video made a "ransomware", but i decided to take the code and change it from being a ransomware to being an encryption script.
